# [Movie108](https://news365-itsme-subid.vercel.app/)

The agenda of this repository is to help others and myself too.
I personally found it very useful for many times, generally I code a program but forget it very frequently, so this repository help by easy accessibility to my code and also easy to go through the Source code.

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

- Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.
- [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one minute.
- [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.
